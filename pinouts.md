# mk-piclock v1.9.17-rpi-zero-r3 Pinouts

This document covers the Raspberry Pi GPIO header, SSD1322 OLED, MAX98357A I2S amplifier, speaker, TTP223B touch sensor, and common-cathode RGB LED used by mk-piclock.

The software uses **BCM GPIO numbering**. Physical pin numbers refer to the Raspberry Pi 40-pin header.

The external regulated 5 V supply powers the Raspberry Pi through physical pin 4, with supply ground on physical pin 9. The amplifier uses physical pins 2 and 14, so no power connector is physically shared. Raspberry Pi pins 2 and 4 are still electrically connected to the same internal 5 V rail, and all ground pins are common. Do not connect USB power while the header supply is connected.

The build has two 3.3 V consumers: OLED VCC and TTP223B VCC. They use separate Raspberry Pi header pins. Leave the MAX98357A SD / EN pad unconnected.

## Raspberry Pi 40-pin header map

```text
                         Raspberry Pi GPIO header

OLED VCC       <- 3.3V       (1)  (2)  5V          -> MAX98357A VIN
                              (3)  (4)  5V          <- EXTERNAL +5V INPUT
                              (5)  (6)  GND         -> OLED GND
                              (7)  (8)
EXTERNAL GND    -> GND         (9) (10)
                             (11) (12) GPIO18       -> MAX98357A BCLK
OLED RST       <- GPIO27    (13) (14) GND          -> MAX98357A GND

```

Pin 1 is the 3.3 V corner pin. Confirm the header orientation before applying power.

## SSD1322 OLED

The core opens `/dev/spidev0.0`, which uses SPI0 CE0.

```text
SSD1322 OLED          Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------------------
VCC                -> 3.3 V, physical pin 1
GND                -> GND, physical pin 6
DIN / MOSI / D1    -> GPIO10, physical pin 19
CLK / SCLK / D0    -> GPIO11, physical pin 23
CS                 -> GPIO8 CE0, physical pin 24
DC / A0            -> GPIO25, physical pin 22
RST / RES           -> GPIO27, physical pin 13
```

OLED settings compiled into `mk-piclock.c`:

```text
SPI device: /dev/spidev0.0
SPI mode:   0
SPI speed:  4 MHz
DC:         BCM GPIO25
RST:        BCM GPIO27
```

Notes:

- The OLED does not use SPI MISO. GPIO9, physical pin 21, remains unused.
- Connect CS to CE0. Do not tie CS low when using `/dev/spidev0.0` unless the specific module requires it and no other SPI device shares the bus.
- SSD1322 module header order varies. Follow the signal labels printed on the module, not the position shown in a seller photograph.
- This project wiring uses 3.3 V for the OLED. Confirm the module is configured for 4-wire SPI.

## MAX98357A I2S amplifier

```text
MAX98357A             Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------------------
VIN                -> 5 V, physical pin 2
GND                -> GND, physical pin 14
BCLK               -> GPIO18, physical pin 12
LRC / LRCLK / WS   -> GPIO19, physical pin 35
DIN                -> GPIO21, physical pin 40
SD / EN            -> Not connected
```

Required `/boot/firmware/config.txt` settings:

```ini
dtparam=audio=off
dtoverlay=max98357a,no-sdmode
```

`no-sdmode` means mk-piclock does not control the amplifier SD or EN input from a GPIO. On the tested module, leaving SD / EN unconnected allows the module's onboard bias network to enable playback and select its default mono mix. Do not connect SD / EN to a Raspberry Pi GPIO or directly to 3.3 V.

### Audio startup click

A small click when playback starts is accepted in this release. SD / EN remains unconnected, and mk-piclock does not add amplifier switching, a persistent silence stream, or other click-suppression logic. See `RASPBERRY_PI_SPEAKER_POP.md` for the full investigation, test history, and possible future solution.

## Speaker

Connect the speaker only to the MAX98357A output:

```text
MAX98357A SPK+  -> Speaker +
MAX98357A SPK-  -> Speaker -
```

Important:

- Do not connect either speaker terminal to Raspberry Pi ground.
- The MAX98357A speaker output is differential.
- Use one compatible 4 to 8 ohm speaker.
- Disconnect power before changing speaker or amplifier wiring.

## TTP223B touch sensor

```text
TTP223B               Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------------------
VCC                -> 3.3 V, physical pin 17
GND                -> GND, physical pin 39
OUT / SIG          -> GPIO20, physical pin 38
```

The core reads GPIO20 as an active-high input and applies software debounce.

```text
Short press:   stop current audio
Hold 3 seconds: play random uploaded music
```

Power the TTP223B from **3.3 V**. Do not power it from 5 V while OUT is directly connected to a Raspberry Pi GPIO.

## Common-cathode RGB LED

```text
RGB LED                Raspberry Pi
Red anode, resistor -> GPIO5, physical pin 29
Green anode, resistor -> GPIO6, physical pin 31
Blue anode, resistor -> GPIO13, physical pin 33
Common cathode      -> GND, physical pin 30
```

Use one 220 to 330 ohm current-limiting resistor on each colour channel. The software drives the three anodes active-high using 200 Hz batched trailing-edge PWM with 32 stable duty levels. This wiring is for a common-cathode LED. A common-anode module requires inverted output logic and is not supported by this release.

The Lighting page includes direct red, green, blue, and white wiring tests. These tests temporarily bypass the master switch, global brightness ceiling, and colour calibration so each physical channel can be checked independently.

## Pre-power checklist

- Confirm every module shares Raspberry Pi ground.
- Confirm the OLED VCC wire is on 3.3 V, not a GPIO.
- Confirm the touch sensor VCC wire is on 3.3 V.
- Confirm the RGB LED is common-cathode and each colour has a current-limiting resistor.
- Confirm the amplifier SD / EN pad is not connected.
- Confirm amplifier DIN is connected to GPIO21, physical pin 40, and is not tied to 3.3 V.
- Confirm the speaker connects to `SPK+` and `SPK-`, not ground.
- Check for solder bridges before applying power.
- Enable SPI and the MAX98357A overlay before starting the services.
